# Auth0 + AngularJS + API Seed

This is the seed project you need to use if you're going to create an AngularJS app that will use Auth0 and connect to a third party API like Firebase or Amazon.

## Running the example

In order to run the example you need to just start a server. What we suggest is doing the following:

1. Install node
1. run npm install -g serve
1. run serve in the directory of this project.

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you'll see the app running :).
